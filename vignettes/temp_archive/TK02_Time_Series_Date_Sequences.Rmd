Creating and modifying date sequences is critical to machine learning projects. We discuss:

- Making a Time Series Sequence: `tk_make_timeseries()`
- Making a Future Sequence: `tk_make_future_timeseries()`
- Holiday & Weekday/Weekend Sequences


# Prerequisites

Before we get started, load the following packages.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)
```

# Making a Time Series Sequence

`tk_make_timeseries()` improves on the `seq.Date()` and `seq.POSIXt()` functions by simplifying into 1 function. Intelligently handles character dates and logical assumptions based on user inputs.

__By Day__

- Can use `by = "day"` or leave blank. 
- `include_endpoints = FALSE` removes the last value so your series is only 7 observations. 

```{r}
# Selects by day automatically
tk_make_timeseries("2011", length_out = "7 days", include_endpoints = FALSE)
```

__By 2 Seconds__

- Can use `by = "2 sec"` to adjust the interval width.
- `include_endpoints = TRUE` keeps the last value the series ends on the 6th second. 

```{r}
# Guesses by second
tk_make_timeseries("2016", by = "2 sec", length_out = "6 seconds")
```

__Length Out = 1 year 6 months__

- `length_out = "1 year 6 months"` - Can include complex expressions like "1 year 4 months 6 days".

```{r}
tk_make_timeseries("2012-07", 
                   by = "1 month",
                   length_out = "1 year 6 months", 
                   include_endpoints = FALSE)
```

__Go In Reverse__

- To go in reverse, just use `end_date` as where you want the series to end. 

```{r}
tk_make_timeseries(end_date = "2012-07-01", 
                   by = "1 month",
                   length_out = "1 year 6 months")
```

# Future Time Series Sequence

A common operation is to make a future time series sequence that mimics an existing. This is what `tk_make_future_timeseries()` is for. 


Suppose we have an existing time index. 

```{r}
idx <- tk_make_timeseries("2012", by = "3 months", 
                          length_out = "2 years", 
                          include_endpoints = FALSE)
idx
```

__Make a Future Time Series from an Existing__

We can create a future time sequence from the existing sequence using `tk_make_future_timeseries()`. 

```{r}
tk_make_future_timeseries(idx, length_out = "2 years")
```


# Weekends & Holidays

__Make weekday sequence removing holidays__

- Result is 252 days.

```{r}
idx <- tk_make_weekday_sequence("2012",
                                remove_weekends = TRUE, 
                                remove_holidays = TRUE, calendar = "NYSE")

tk_get_timeseries_summary(idx)
```

__Which holidays were removed?__

- NYSE Trading holidays which are days most businesses observe 

```{r}
tk_make_holiday_sequence("2012", calendar = "NYSE")
```


__Make future index removing holidays__

```{r}
holidays <- tk_make_holiday_sequence(
    start_date = "2013-01-01",
    end_date   = "2013-12-31",
    calendar   = "NYSE")

idx_future <- idx %>%
   tk_make_future_timeseries(length_out       = "1 year",
                             inspect_weekdays = TRUE,
                             skip_values      = holidays)

tk_get_timeseries_summary(idx_future)
```
