> timetk: A toolkit for time series analysis in the tidyverse

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```


This tutorial focuses on, `plot_time_series()`, a workhorse time-series plotting function that:

- Generates interactive `plotly` plots (great for exploring & shiny apps)
- Consolidates 20+ lines of `ggplot2` & `plotly` code
- Scales well to many time series
- Can be converted from interactive `plotly` to static `ggplot2` plots

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(timetk)

# Setup for the plotly charts (# FALSE returns ggplots)
interactive <- FALSE
```

# Plotting Single Time Series

Let's start with a popular time series, `taylor_30_min`, which includes energy demand in megawatts at a sampling interval of 30-minutes. This is a single time series. 

```{r}
taylor_30_min
```

The `plot_time_series()` function generates an interactive `plotly` chart by default. 

- Simply provide the date variable (time-based column, `.date_var`) and the numeric variable (`.value`) that changes over time as the first 2 arguments 
- When `.interactive = TRUE`, the `.plotly_slider = TRUE` adds a date slider to the bottom of the chart. 

```{r}
taylor_30_min %>% 
  plot_time_series(date, value, 
                   .interactive = interactive,
                   .plotly_slider = TRUE)
```


# Plotting Groups

Next, let's move on to a dataset with time series groups, `m4_daily`, which is a sample of 4 time series from the M4 competition that are sampled at a daily frequency. 

```{r}
m4_daily %>% group_by(id)
```

Visualizing grouped data is as simple as grouping the data set with `group_by()` prior to piping into the `plot_time_series()` function. Key points:

- Groups can be added in 2 ways: by `group_by()` or by using the `...` to add groups. 
- Groups are then converted to facets. 
- `.facet_ncol = 2` returns a 2-column faceted plot
- `.facet_scales = "free"` allows the x and y-axis of each plot to scale independently of the other plots

```{r}
m4_daily %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  plot_time_series(date, value, 
                   .facet_ncol = 2, .facet_scales = "free",
                   .interactive = interactive)
```



# Visualizing Transformations & Sub-Groups

Let's switch to an hourly dataset with multiple groups. We can showcase:

1. Log transformation to the `.value`
2. Use of `.color_var` to highlight sub-groups. 

```{r}
m4_hourly %>% group_by(id)
```

The intent is to showcase the groups in faceted plots, but to highlight weekly windows (sub-groups) within the data while simultaneously doing a `log()` transformation to the value. This is simple to do:

1. `.value = log(value)` Applies the Log Transformation
2. `.color_var = week(date)` The date column is transformed to a `lubridate::week()` number. The color is applied to each of the week numbers. 

```{r}
m4_hourly %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  plot_time_series(date, log(value),             # Apply a Log Transformation
                   .color_var = week(date),      # Color applied to Week transformation
                   # Facet formatting
                   .facet_ncol = 2, 
                   .facet_scales = "free", 
                   .interactive = interactive)
```

# Static ggplot2 Visualizations & Customizations

All of the visualizations can be converted from interactive `plotly` (great for exploring and shiny apps) to static `ggplot2` visualizations (great for reports).

```{r}
taylor_30_min %>%
  plot_time_series(date, value, 
                   .color_var = month(date, label = TRUE),
                   
                   # Returns static ggplot
                   .interactive = FALSE,  
                   
                   # Customization
                   .title = "Taylor's MegaWatt Data",
                   .x_lab = "Date (30-min intervals)",
                   .y_lab = "Energy Demand (MW)",
                   .color_lab = "Month") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())
```
